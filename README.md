## Overview
### Description
This app will be designed to enable users to search and select from over a hundred of recipes from a database. They will be able to store the recipes to view and attempt later. Once a recipe is selected, the user will be brought to another page with an image of the recipe, a list of the ingredients, serving size, calorie, and instructions. There will be a page to contact support in case a user needs help or has suggestions for new recipes.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Food & Drink
- **Mobile:** This app will be developed for mobile-use only as of now. While it is feasible to create a web application, we have decided it is more convenient for the user if they can search for and read off recipes from their handphone and upload photos of what they created. 
- **Story:** The user starts a search for a recipe and selects one. They will view the details and if interested, choose to recreate the recipe or if not, go back to the search form. If they recreate it, they can upload a photo of their creation online.
- **Market:** Home cooks that are looking to improve their culinary skills in a fun, interactive way. 
- **Habit:** The user is free to use the app whenever they are interested in making a homemade meal. This can be as often as multiple times a day or less frequent such as once a week. 
- **Scope:** We want to create an app and community where users can conveniently look up a recipe, recreate it, and post photos. Eventually we would like to expand this to be more interactive by establishing a point system for each recipe recreated and leadership board. Perhaps we will also have discussion boards.
